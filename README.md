# Simple Recipe Website

This repository contains the code for a simple recipe website, created as part of the "Web 1 Project" coursework. The website provides a basic structure for showcasing recipes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills by creating a multi-page website using HTML and CSS. The site features a homepage with links to different recipe categories and individual recipe pages. It focuses on basic layout, navigation, and content presentation.

## Key Features

* **Homepage:** Provides an introduction to the website and links to various recipe categories.
* **Recipe Category Pages:** Dedicated pages for different types of recipes (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts).
* **Individual Recipe Pages:** Detailed pages for specific recipes, including ingredients and instructions.
* **Navigation:** A simple navigation bar allows users to easily move between different sections of the website.
* **Basic Styling:** The website is styled using CSS to create a clean and organized presentation.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## How to Run

To view this website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The other HTML files (within the `appetizers`, `desserts`, and `main-courses` folders) can be accessed through the links on the homepage or by directly opening the respective `.html` files in your browser.

## Reflections on the "Web 1 Project"

This project allowed me to practice structuring a multi-page website using HTML and applying basic styling with CSS. I focused on creating a clear and intuitive navigation system and organizing content logically across different pages. While the website is simple, it provided a solid foundation in understanding fundamental web development concepts.

## Further Improvements (Optional)

* Adding more recipes and recipe categories.
* Implementing more advanced CSS styling for a more visually appealing design.
* Making the website responsive so it adapts to different screen sizes.
* Potentially adding basic JavaScript for interactive elements.
